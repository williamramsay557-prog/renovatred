- **Documentation Cleanup**: Removed 15 outdated .md files
  - Deleted old audit reports, phase summaries, and redundant guides
  - Kept only active legal docs, setup guides, and deployment documentation
  - Reduced documentation files from 25 to 10 essential files
- **Required Setup**: Supabase Storage bucket "images" must be created
  - See SUPABASE_STORAGE_SETUP.md for 5-minute setup guide
  - Bucket must be public for photo display
  - Server-side upload with user-scoped folders (public/{userId}/)

### October 31, 2025 - Production Security Infrastructure (Phase 2) ✅ COMPLETE
- **Database Security (RLS)**: Deployed 56 comprehensive Row-Level Security policies
  - 28 policies across 8 tables (users, projects, tasks, rooms, friends, feed_posts, post_comments, post_likes)
  - 4 storage bucket policies with user-scoped folders (public/{userId}/)
  - Ownership-based access control - users can only access their own data
  - Friends-only visibility for social features
  - **Security Rating**: Improved from ⭐ to ⭐⭐⭐⭐½ (production-ready)
- **Server API Infrastructure**: Built 14 authenticated REST endpoints
  - Projects CRUD (5 endpoints), Tasks CRUD (3), Rooms CRUD (3), Upload (1), Health (1)
  - JWT authentication required on all endpoints
  - Comprehensive Zod validation (17-field taskSchema prevents data loss)
  - Ownership verification enforced server-side
  - Rate limiting (20 req/min) and payload size limits (1MB max)
- **Client Migration**: Migrated 12 critical functions to secure server API
  - Feature flag system: USE_SERVER_API controls which path to use

  - All functions RLS-compatible on both server and client paths
  - Image upload uses secure user-scoped folders: public/{userId}/filename
- **Deployment Strategy**: Option 2 - Gradual Rollout
  - RLS policies secure database for ALL access patterns (client + server)
  - Safe hybrid state: migrated functions ready, unmigrated functions use client + RLS
  - Zero downtime deployment - app continues working normally
  - Can enable server API incrementally per function
