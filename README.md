# Renovatr - A Social DIY Renovation Assistant

This document outlines the architecture of the Renovatr application.

## 1. Project Overview & Architecture

Renovatr is a powerful application with a full-stack architecture powered by Supabase and Google Gemini.

-   **Frontend:** A responsive React application built with TypeScript.
-   **Backend (`Supabase`):** The backend is built on Supabase, which provides a Postgres database, authentication, storage, and auto-generated APIs.
-   **Data Services (`services/projectService.ts`):** This service layer contains all the logic for communicating with the Supabase backend. It handles all database operations and file uploads.
-   **Authentication (`services/authService.ts`):** This service handles user sign-up, sign-in, and session management using Supabase Auth.
-   **AI Core (`geminiService.ts`):** This service handles all interactions with the Google Gemini API, following the principles of the "Renovatr AI Charter".

## 2. Getting Started: Supabase Setup

To run this application, you must first set up a Supabase project and configure the database schema.

**All instructions and the required SQL code are located in `README-SUPABASE.md`. Please follow that guide carefully.**

## 3. Activating Affiliate Link Revenue

Once the app is running with the Supabase backend, you can activate the monetization feature.

1.  **Sign Up:** Create accounts with affiliate programs (e.g., Amazon Associates). You will receive a unique affiliate ID (e.g., `your-tag-21`).
2.  **Update Gemini Service:** In `services/geminiService.ts`, locate the `generateTaskDetails` function.
3.  **Action:** Find the `addAffiliateTag` helper function and replace the placeholder tag (`RENOVATR-21`) with your actual affiliate ID. All links generated by the AI will now be monetized.

## 4. Submitting to the App Store (iOS & Android)

The application is prepared for mobile deployment using **Capacitor**.

1.  **Prerequisites:** You must have a live, deployed web application (running with a production Supabase project).
2.  **Developer Accounts:** Sign up for an Apple Developer Account (~$99/year) and a Google Play Developer Account (~$25 one-time).
3.  **Build the Web App:** Run the build command (e.g., `npm run build`) to create an optimized version of your site in a `dist` folder.
4.  **Use Capacitor:**
    -   Install the Capacitor CLI in your project.
    -   Run `npx cap add ios` and `npx cap add android`. This will use the `capacitor.config.ts` file to create native iOS and Android project wrappers around your web app.
    -   Run `npx cap open ios` to open the project in Xcode.
    -   Run `npx cap open android` to open the project in Android Studio.
5.  **Submit for Review:** From Xcode and Android Studio, you can build the final app package and follow the on-screen instructions to submit it to the App Store and Google Play Store for review.
