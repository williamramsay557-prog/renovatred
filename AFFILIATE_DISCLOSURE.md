# Affiliate Disclosure

**Last Updated:** 31 October 2025

## Amazon Associates Programme

Renovatr is a participant in the Amazon EU Associates Programme, an affiliate advertising programme designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon.co.uk.

## What This Means

### Affiliate Links
Product recommendations and material lists in our Service may include links to Amazon.co.uk. These are affiliate links.

### Commissions
When you click on these links and make a purchase on Amazon, we may earn a small commission (typically 1-3% of the purchase price) at **no extra cost to you**.

### Pricing
- Product prices are identical whether you use our links or go directly to Amazon
- You pay the same amount
- We simply receive a referral fee from Amazon

## Our Recommendation Policy

### Independent Recommendations
Our AI assistant recommends products based on:
- Your project requirements
- Product suitability and quality
